                        <h3>WHO WAS NAPOLEON?</h3>
                        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again briefly in 1815.</p>

                        <h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
                        <p>Born on the island of Corsica, Napoleon was trained as an artillery officer in mainland France. He rose through the ranks during the French Revolution and established himself as a successful military leader. His campaigns in Italy and Egypt brought him great fame and political power.</p>

                        <h3>EMPEROR OF FRANCE</h3>
                        <p>In 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French, establishing the First French Empire. During his reign, he implemented numerous reforms that have endured to the present day, including the Napoleonic Code, which influenced legal systems around the world.</p>
                        <p>Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade, leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over much of continental Europe.</p>

                        <h3>DOWNFALL</h3>
                        <p>The tide turned against Napoleon following the disastrous French invasion of Russia in 1812. A year later, the Sixth Coalition defeated his forces at the Battle of Leipzig. After his exile to the island of Elba, he escaped and returned to power briefly in 1815 (the "Hundred Days"), but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo.</p>
                        <p>Napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821, most likely from stomach cancer.</p>

                        <p>Napoleon's influence on the modern world has been significant, with his political and cultural legacy enduring to this day. He brought liberal reforms to the territories he conquered, such as the abolition of feudalism and the implementation of legal equality. He remains one of the most celebrated and controversial figures in world history.</p>

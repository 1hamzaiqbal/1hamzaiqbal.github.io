                        <h3>WHO WAS RASPUTIN?</h3>
                        <p>Grigori Rasputin (1869-1916) was a Russian mystic and self-proclaimed holy man who befriended the family of Tsar Nicholas II, the last monarch of Russia, and gained considerable influence in late imperial Russia.</p>

                    <div class="bio-section">
                        <h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
                        <p>Born to a peasant family in Siberia, Rasputin underwent a religious conversion as a young man and claimed to have healing powers. He traveled as a wandering holy man (strannik) and eventually made his way to St. Petersburg in 1903, where his reputation as a healer and prophet preceded him.</p>

                        <h3>RISE TO POWER</h3>
                        <p>Rasputin was introduced to the Russian imperial family in 1905, when Tsarina Alexandra was desperate for someone who could help her hemophiliac son, Alexei. Rasputin appeared to have a miraculous ability to stop the Tsarevich's bleeding episodes, which earned him the royal family's unwavering trust.</p>
                        <p>As his influence grew, Rasputin began to interfere in Russian politics, making government appointments and affecting military decisions during World War I, which severely damaged the Romanov dynasty's reputation.</p>

                    <div class="bio-section">
                        <h3>REPUTATION & CONTROVERSY</h3>
                        <p>Rasputin was a controversial figure, known for his claimed mystical powers and alleged debauchery. His undue influence over the imperial family generated extensive rumors and turned public opinion against the Romanovs, contributing to the Russian Revolution.</p>
                        <p>His alleged sexual exploits, drinking binges, and corrupt political influence made him infamous in Russian society, with many viewing him as a dark, sinister force behind the throne.</p>

                    <div class="bio-section">
                        <h3>ASSASSINATION</h3>
                        <p>Fearful of his growing power, a group of nobles led by Prince Felix Yusupov plotted to kill Rasputin in December 1916. According to legend, he was poisoned, shot multiple times, beaten, and finally drowned in the freezing Neva River, showing extraordinary resilience that fueled myths about his supernatural powers.</p>
